JS assignments at Unicorn University:

Assignment 2
Create a JavaScript program that converts a number from one number system to another. You choose which number systems to convert between. 
The program will contain at least one function that will take as an input argument the number to be converted. 
The return value of this function will in turn contain the number to be converted in the desired number system.


Assignment 3
Design and create a program in JavaScript programming language that generates a list of company employees. 
Your program will contain a main function with one argument that will contain the input data dtoIn. The main function will return the output data dtoOut.
Part of the solution is to design the program described using the Algorithm component.
Each employee (Employee) has a first name (firstname), last name (surname), sex (gender), date of birth (birthdate) and amount of workload (workload). 
Persons can be either male or female, and the workload is either 10, 20, 30 or 40 hours/week. Full-time corresponds to 40h/week. 
Individual data will be generated randomly, i.e. you will randomly generate first name, last name, date of birth, etc.

Assignment 4
Design and create a program in the JavaScript programming language that builds on 
BSDE 2023 Winter Homework Assignment / homework assignment 03 - generate a list of company employees. 
Extend your program to determine the following values based on the generated list:
number of employees
number of employees by level of time (10, 20, 30 and 40h/week)
average age (rounded to one decimal place)
minimum age (youngest employee)
maximum age (oldest employee)
median age
median amount of time
average amount of time worked by women
list of employees sorted by seniority from least to greatest
Your program will contain a main function with one argument that will contain the input data dtoIn. 
Within the main function, you should call the generateEmployeeData function with dtoIn to ensure that the list is generated, 
and then the getEmployeeStatistics function to ensure that the necessary values are obtained from the employee list. 
The main function will return the output data dtoOut.

Assignment 5

Design and create a program in JavaScript programming language that builds on 
BSDE 2023 Winter Homework Assignment / homework assignment 03 - generate a list of company employees. 
Extend your program by using the generated list to determine the most common first names within:
all employees
women
men
female part-time employees (i.e. 10, 20 or 30 hours/week)
full-time men (i.e. 40h/week)
Your program will contain a main function with one argument that will contain the input data dtoIn. 
Within the main function, you should call the generateEmployeeData function to ensure that the list is generated, 
and then the getEmployeeChartContent function to ensure that the required values are retrieved from the employee list. 
The main function will return dtoOut output data.
